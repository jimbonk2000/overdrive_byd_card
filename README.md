# Overdrive BYD Card

A modern, real-time Home Assistant dashboard card for BYD vehicles powered by Overdrive.

This project transforms raw BYD telemetry into a polished connected-car experience directly inside Home Assistant using MQTT and the Overdrive platform.

Designed specifically for BYD vehicles running Overdrive v12+, the card provides live telemetry, climate controls, charging information, tire monitoring, lighting status, vehicle controls, and advanced battery data in a clean modern UI.

# Huge Credit to Overdrive

This entire project would not exist without the incredible work done by Yash Srivastava.

The actual vehicle communication, telemetry access, command systems, reverse engineering, MQTT support, and Overdrive platform were created by him through the Overdrive project:

https://github.com/yash-srivastava/Overdrive-release

Overdrive is one of the most advanced open-source BYD projects currently available and enables features such as:

• Real-time vehicle telemetry  
• Vehicle controls  
• Climate controls  
• MQTT integration  
• Vehicle diagnostics  
• Dashcam functionality  
• Sentry mode  
• Local HAL integration  
• Advanced BYD reverse engineering  

This Home Assistant integration and dashboard card are built specifically to extend, visualize, and integrate the amazing work already done in Overdrive.

Massive respect and appreciation to Yash for pushing the BYD community forward and making projects like this possible.

Please support the original project and star the repository.
